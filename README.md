 Current changes done to the original Code:
 Flixel Implementation
 BlurEffect support
 Some very minor fix stuff

  ## Usage/Current Limitations

  This is a very early build, but it works(kinda), so there's a few limitations, including:
  -Animate 2018 Only (i don't fucking know why)
  -Not all Animate Effects are working yet(BlurEffect works, but GlowEffect etc. doesn't, also very laggy)
  -Generated bitmaps cut off sometimes(Might be able to fix that soon)

  How to do the thing:
  Make a movieclip in Animate, put all animations with their frames in there. Then, click on the first frame of each animation, go to "Properties", and give the animation a label. That label will be the animation name.

  Usage in Flixel is made as easy as possible, you give it to a Sprite just like a normal Spritesheet animation:

 `sprite.frames = AtlasFrameMaker(Path,widthoffset,heightoffset,excludeArray)`
 
 Path is the path to the folder that's generated by Animate(duh).
 Width- and Heightoffset are a temporary fix to the cutting off bitmap issue(I'm trying to fix it rn gimme a bit).
 excludeArray excludes animations from being created. Let's say you have 2 GF versions on 1 TextureAtlas, you could exclude the animations from the one that you don't need currently,making it load faster.
